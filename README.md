This is a repo for KPMG's virtual internship tasks.
The IPYNB file is my attempt at cleaning the data sets with python.
It is quite self explanatory.
The solution_with_excel file is done with excel and is not the excel file read by the IPYNB file.
The excel file read by the IPYNB file is the KPMG_VI_New_raw_data_update_final file.
